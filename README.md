## Developing

> This site uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to pre-process Sass and JavaScript files.
When editing the theme's javascript or stylesheets, make sure to edit the source files and not
the files located in the `dist` directory.

- To edit stylesheets, edit the files in `assets/stylesheets`
- To edit javascript, edit the files in `assets/javascripts/src`

Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed.

Install NPM dependencies

`npm install`

Watch for file changes and rebuild assets

`npm run build`
